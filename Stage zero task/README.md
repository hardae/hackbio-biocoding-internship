# Stage Zero Task - Final Solution
## Project Overview
This repository contains the solution to the Stage Zero Task.
The task involves storing and displaying the nested information of five group members using Python's dictionary data structure.
The final solution is documented in the “Stage zero Karimah file.”
## Data Structure
- Dictionary: The dictionary was used to store key-value pairs where each key represents an attribute (name, Slack username, email, hobbies, disciplines, countries, preferred programming languages), and the value represents the corresponding information of the group members.
The data stored includes:
- Names
- Slack Usernames
- Emails
- Hobbies
- Disciplines
- Countries
- Preferred Programming Languages
The information is organized to be easily accessible and printable.
## Features
- Stores detailed information on five members of the group.
- Prints the information of all members in a readable format.
## Usage
To view the final solution, simply navigate to the “Stage zero Karimah” document within this repository. You can also execute the Python script to see the output of the dictionary data.
